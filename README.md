This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q Network using Pytorch on a GridWorld environment with walls based off of Gym's GridWorld.

This repository is no longer maintained, as Gym is not longer maintained and all future maintenance of it will occur in the replacing [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) library. You can contribute Gymnasium examples to the Gymnasium repository and docs directly if you would like to. If you'd like to learn more about the transition from Gym to Gymnasium, you can read more about it [here](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation).

# Gym Examples
